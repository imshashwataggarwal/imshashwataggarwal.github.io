# Introduction

The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) **\[1\]** is the de facto _“hello world”_ dataset for anyone getting started with computer vision. It contains a total of 70,000 examples divided into training and testing sets (6:1). Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. Various emerging machine learning [techniques](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) have been tested with the MNIST, that has remained a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. More recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of Deep Neural Networks have demonstrated immense success in the field of computer vision **\[2\]**. The MNIST dataset, in particular, has been effectively classified using architectures of this type, with the current state-of-the-art at a high **99.79%** accuracy **\[3\]**.

MNIST is a good database for people who want to get acquainted with computer vision and pattern recognition methods to solve real-world problems, but most of the real-world vision problems like autonomous robots and scene understanding deal with 3D datasets. The availability of 3D data has been increasing rapidly as the use of sensors which provide 3D spatial readings in autonomous vehicles and robots becomes more prevalent. For this reason, the ability of these machines to automatically identify and make inferences about this data has become a crucial task for them to operate autonomously.

Recently, a 3D version of the MNIST was released on Kaggle **\[4\]**_._ The dataset was created by generating 3D point clouds from the images of the digits in the original 2D MNIST. The script for generating point clouds can be found [here](https://github.com/Harry-Zhi/3DMNIST/blob/master/3DMNIST.ipynb). This dataset can be considered as a good starting point for getting familiar with 3D vision tasks. In this blog post, we explore this dataset and empirically compare the performance of various machine learning and deep learning based algorithms for the classification of 3D digits.

<br>

# Overview of 3D MNIST Dataset

The 3D MNIST dataset is available in [HDF5 file format](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/daavoo/3d-mnist/data). The dataset contains 3D point clouds, i.e., sets of `(x, y, z)` coordinates generated from a portion of the original 2D MNIST dataset (around 5,000 images). The point clouds have zero mean and a maximum dimension range of 1. Each [HDF5 group](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/fileorg.html) contains:

*   “_points_” dataset: `x, y, z` coordinates of each 3D point in the point cloud.
*   “_normals_” dataset: `nx, ny, nz` components of the unit normal associate to each point.
*   “_img_” dataset: the original MNIST image.
*   “_label_” attribute: the original MNIST label.

In addition to train and test point clouds, the dataset also contains `full_dataset_vectors.h5` that stores _4096-D_ vectors obtained from voxelization of all the 3D point clouds and their randomly rotated copies with noise. The `full_dataset_vectors.h5` is splitted into _4_ groups:

{% highlight python %}
X_train = f["X_train"][:]    # shape: (10000, 4096)
y_train = f["y_train"][:]    # shape: (10000,)   
X_test  = f["X_test"][:]     # shape: (2000, 4096) 
y_test  = f["y_test"][:]     # shape: (2000,)
{% endhighlight %}


Here is an example to read a digit and store its group content in a tuple.

{% highlight python %}
with h5.File('train_point_clouds.h5', 'r') as f:  
    # Reading digit at zeroth index      
    a = f["0"]     
    # Storing group contents of digit a  
    digit = (a["img"][:], a["points"][:], a.attrs["label"])
{% endhighlight %}


Let’s first visualize the contents stored in the tuple with `matplotlib`. The following code plots the first 15 images from the original 2D MNIST with their corresponding labels:

{% highlight python %}
# Plot some examples from original 2D-MNIST  
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,5, figsize=(12, 12), facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')

fig.subplots_adjust(hspace = .5, wspace=.2)

for ax, d in zip(axs.ravel(), digits):  
    ax.imshow(d[0][:])  
    ax.set_title("Digit: " + str(d[2]))
{% endhighlight %}

<br>

<figcaption> First 15 example images along with their labels from the 2D MNIST.</figcaption>

<br>

Before visualizing the 3D point clouds, let’s first discuss about Voxelization. **_Voxelization_** is the process of conversion of a geometric object from its continuous geometric representation into a set of voxels that best approximates the continuous object. The process mimics the scan-conversion process that rasterizes 2D geometric objects, and is also referred to as [3D scan-conversion](http://labs.cs.sunysb.edu/labs/projects/volume/Papers/glossary.html#voxelization:).

![](https://github.com/imshashwataggarwal/imshashwataggarwal.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/1.png)

<figcaption>Voxel Grid with a single voxel shaded. Source: [5]</figcaption>

<br>

We use this process to fit an axis-aligned bounding box called the Voxel Grid around the point clouds and subdivide the grid into segments, assigning each point in the point cloud to one of the sub boxes (known as voxels, analogous to pixels). We split the grid into 16 segments along each axis resulting in a total of 4096 voxels, equivalent to the 4th level of an Octree.

{% highlight python %}
voxel_grid = VoxelGrid(digit, x_y_z = [16, 16, 16])
{% endhighlight %}


The code above generates a voxel grid of `16 × 16 × 16 = 4096` voxels, with the structure attribute representing a 2D array, where each row represents a point in the original point cloud and each column represents the `n_voxel` where it lies with respect to `[x_axis, y_axis, z_axis, global]`.

{% highlight python %}
voxel_grid.structure[0]
{% endhighlight %}
```
array([ 5, 3, 7, 477])
```

The histogram shown below visualize the number of points present within each voxel. From the plot, it can be seen that there are a lot of empty voxels. This is due to the use of a cuboid bounding box to ensure that the Voxel Grid will divide the cloud in a similar way even when the point clouds are oriented to different directions.

{% highlight python %}
# Get the count of points within each voxel.  
plt.title("DIGIT: " + str(digits[0][-1]))  
plt.xlabel("VOXEL")  
plt.ylabel("POINTS INSIDE THE VOXEL")  
count_plot(voxels[0].structure[:,-1])   
{% endhighlight %}

<figcaption>Number of Points within each Voxel for a sample of digit 5.</figcaption>

<br>

We can visualize the Voxel Grid using the built-in helper function `plot()` defined in the file _plot3D.py_ provided along with the dataset. This function displays the sliced spatial views of the Voxel Grid around the z-axis.

```
>>> # Visualizing the Voxel Grid sliced around the z-axis.

>>> voxels[0].plot()  
>>> plt.show()
```

<br>

Now we visualize the 3D point clouds using an open-source 3D software, [**CloudCompare**](http://www.danielgm.net/cc/). We save the Voxel Grid structure as the scalar fields of the original point clouds and render 3D images with CloudCompare.

```
>>> # Save Voxel Grid Structure as the scalar field of Point Cloud.  
>>> cloud_vis = np.concatenate((digit[1], voxel_grid.structure), axis=1)

>>> np.savetxt('Cloud Visualization - ' + str(digit[2]) + '.txt', cloud_vis)
```

At last, before moving on to the classification task, just for fun, let’s visualize the animation of 3D data slice by slice. Both the rows of the plot show the animation of slices along `x, y, z-axis` for the digits _5_ and _0_.

# Sklearn Machine Learning Classifiers

We use the `full_vectors.h5` dataset. You can use this or generate your own using this [script](https://github.com/imshashwataggarwal/AI/blob/e51f942210de27edcdcf62138cc89c3c1a9cd1b7/Blogs/3D%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification/create_dataset.py#L1-L30). In machine learning, there’s something called the **_“No Free Lunch”_** theorem that in a nutshell, states that no one algorithm works best for every problem. So we try many machine learning algorithms and choose the best suited to our problem.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mcI34Fc0wZ0x-MbZ.jpg)

<center> _No Free Lunch!_ </center>

<br>

Let’s start with the simplest yet powerful machine learning classifier — **_Logistic Regression_**:

```
>>> reg = LogisticRegression()  
>>> reg.fit(X_train, y_train)  
>>> print("Accuracy: ", reg.score(X_test, y_test))
```

**Accuracy:  0.582**

Logistic Regression provides a decent baseline for other classifiers with an test-accuracy score of 58.2%. 

Next we move on to **_Decision Trees_**_:_

```
>>> dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()  
>>> dt.fit(X_train, y_train)  
>>> print("Accuracy: ", dt.score(X_test, y_test))
```

**Accuracy:  0.4865**

Decision Trees gives a test-accuracy of 48.65%, i.e. 10 points lower as compared to Logistic Regression. The performance of Decision Trees can possibly be improved with hyper-parameter tuning and grid-search. But here, we stick to the basics and try to get a rough estimate of the performance of the classifier. 

Moving further, let’s try **_Support Vector Machines_**:

```
>>> svm = LinearSVC()  
>>> svm.fit(X_train, y_train)  
>>> print("Accuracy: ", svm.score(X_test, y_test))
```

**Accuracy:  0.557**

We use linear SVMs instead of RBF or Poly kernel based SVM as they take a lot of time to train (_you may try training these SVM variants and compare their performance against other classifiers_). Linear SVMs perform similar to Logistic Regression with a test-accuracy score of 55.7%. 

Now, giving **_K Nearest Neighbors_** a shot!

```
>>> knn = KNN()  
>>> knn.fit(X_train, y_train)  
>>> print("Accuracy: ", knn.score(X_test, y_test))
```

**Accuracy:  0.5905**

KNN performs best among all the previously tried classifiers with 59.05% test-score. 

Finally, let’s ensemble; **_Random Forests:_**

```
>>> rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500)  
>>> rf.fit(X_train, y_train)  
>>> print("Accuracy: ", rf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

**Accuracy:  0.685**

Random Forests outperforms all other classifiers on the classification task. The table below reports the test-accuracy of each classifier on the 3D MNIST dataset. The confusion matrix plots shown below, provides us with the classification report summary of three classifiers namely, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forests. From these plots, we observe that most of the classifiers experience difficulty in classifying digits _5_, _6_ and _9_ correctly while find classifying digits like _0_, _1_ and _4_ easy.

<center>
<br>

| Classifier        | Accuracy (%) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Logistic Regression      | 58.2 | 
| Decision Trees    | 48.65      |  
| Linear SVM | 55.7      |  
| KNN | 59.05       |  
| Random Forests | **68.5**      |  
<br>

You can find the complete [code](https://gist.github.com/imshashwataggarwal/5e27e7a1220b64cca2ab741033cedbe9) for ML-based empirical analysis [here](https://github.com/imshashwataggarwal/AI/blob/master/Blogs/3D%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification/3D%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification.ipynb). Although Random Forests performs best among the tried classifiers, the **68.5%** mark seems way behind its score on the 2D equivalent dataset. So the natural question that arrives is can we do better?

# Moving on to Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been immensely successful in classifying the 2D version of MNIST, with the current state-of-the-art model giving a high **99.79%** accuracy. So now, let’s see how well these CNN perform with the 3D equivalent of MNIST. We create a 4-layered CNN in keras with two dense layers at the top. For the complete definition of the model, look at the `model()` method. Since a sample in our dataset is a 4096-D voxel and CNN expects a 4D tensor of shape: `(batch_size, height, width, input_channels)`, so we reshape our dataset into a 4D tensor: `(-1, 16, 16, 16)`.

> We tried several other shapes such as `(-1, 64, 64, 1)`, `(-1, 64, 64, 3)` but `(-1, 16, 16, 16)` gave the best results, so we stick with this.

## 3D Convolutional Networks in Keras

Finally, we move onto the main objective of this post (:P), 3D CNN. The 3D CNN model is similar to our 2D CNN model. For the complete definition of the model, check the `model()` method. Now, like with 2D CNN, the 3D CNN expects a 5D tensor of shape `(batch_size, conv_dim1, conv_dim2, conv_dim3, input_channels)`. We reshape out input to a 5D tensor — `(-1, 16, 16, 16, 3)`and feed it to our 3D CNN.
